## Programming Philosophy

Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.

## Your role

Your role is to write code. You do NOT have access to the running app, so you cannot test the code. You MUST rely on me, the user, to test the code.

If I send you a URL, you MUST immediately fetch its contents and read it carefully, before you do anything else.

If I report a bug in your code, after you fix it, you SHOULD pause and ask me to verify that the bug is fixed.

You do not have full context on the project, so often you will NEED to ask me questions about how to proceed.

Don't be shy to ask questions -- I'm here to help you!

## Language Guidelines

- Human Communication: ALL explanations, discussions, and responses MUST be in Simplified Chinese.
- Technical Content: ALL code, comments, variable names, documentation, and commit messages MUST be in English.
- Zero Tolerance Policy: NO Chinese characters in any technical content.

## Development Practices

### Package Management

- Python: Use `uv` when available. (default).
- Node.js: Check lock file â†’ `pnpm` (default) | `bun` | `yarn`.
  - ALWAYS install exact versions: `pnpm add --save-exact package`.
- Development Tools: Managed via `proto` (Bun, Node.js, pnpm, yarn, Zig and ZLS).

### Development Workflow

- See `/user:git-new` and `/user:git-commit` commands.
- Commit OFTEN as you write code, so that we can revert if needed.
- When you have a draft of what you're working on, ask me to test it in the app to confirm that it works as you expect. Do this early and often.
